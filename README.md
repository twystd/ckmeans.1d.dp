# ckmeans

Experimental port of [Ckmeans.1d.dp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ckmeans.1d.dp/index.html) v4.3.3 from _R_ to _Go_.

It is basically a brain dead line-for-line port of the underlying _C_ code to _Go_ and _Python_ (in progress).

Mostly because:
- I needed one for _Go_.
- Although there is an existing _Python_ implementation the clustering it returns seems a bit off.
